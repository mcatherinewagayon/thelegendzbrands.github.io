                    <h2>Best Jeans and Denim Brands
                        <br>

                    </h2>
                    <p>The best jeans and denim brands, much like the cut of the pants themselves, are a matter of opinion and often functionality. Some enjoy the designer clothing brands and wear name brand jeans like Guess? and Rock & Republic while others will always pick classic jean brands like Lee and Levi's. Even others will pick the most durable brands, like Wrangler, and wear the sturdy blue jeans for work.</p>
                    <p>Whatever brand of denim you like best, it's likely that you have a pair, or five, laying around somewhere close. From the sexiest jeans to the functional, we all have our favorite pair, that one that fits just right or looks great in the mirror. The best jean brands for an individual person is a matter of lifestyle, taste, and body type.</p>
                    <p>Blue jeans have been favorite fashion choices since the first pairs were created back in the 1850s by Levi Strauss (still one of the original, good jean brands around today). The denim trousers were first targeted towards cowboys, as the thicker material would protect a cowboy's legs, but soon became a popular fashion phenomenon and are an everyday favorite today.</p>
