                    <p>The fashion and apparel industry encompasses a wide variety of garments and uses almost every type of textile manufactured. It is generally subdivided into two categories: clothing for men and boys and clothing for women and girls. According to SelectUSA, a service of the federal government, U.S. textiles, which includes the fashion and apparel industry, "is one of the more important employers in the manufacturing sector..., representing 2 percent of the U.S. manufacturing workforce."</p>
                    <p>Economically, the apparel industry is a key segment for investments, revenue, trade, and employment worldwide. Despite changes in how garments are produced and made available to consumers, which indicate declining employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector, many of the operations at apparel factories are difficult to automate because of the large variety of fabrics and the intricate cutting and sewing required of most fashions, so the fashion industry is likely to remain labor-intensive in coming years. Employment is projected to be strong for workers in retail apparel and accessory stores. Pressing machine operators, custom tailors, and workers whose skills can be used in laundries and dry cleaners also will have strong opportunities. Workers who have knowledge of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing will have the best employment prospects.</p>
                    <p>The greatest change in the apparel industry in the last 50 years has been the migration of manufacturing jobs to Asia. A substantial number of garments are made abroad because of the reduced cost of labor and taxes as well as technologically advanced, well-engineered factories. The quantity of clothing imported increased by more than 300 percent in the late 20th century.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Fashionistas, just like you can never have too many designer shoes, we know you love your designer clothing brands like Versache, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana, but which is the absolute top fashion designer for women? Whether you're a fan of the funky Betsey Johnson or the classic Louis Vuitton, we want to hear which designer you love best and which you wouldn't be caught dead wearing. Add your list of your favorite fashion designers for women and best designer brands and vote for the ones you love or hate.</p>
                    <p>Fashion is a tricky thing to follow and predict as styles and top designer brands change almost as often as the weather. Accordingly, staying trendy can be equally as tricky, and also expensive, but certainly keeps the top designers in business. As many aspiring fashion desingers have learned, it's also a tough business to break into and even harder to stay in. However, as the Valentinos and Chanels prove, some of the best fashion designers for women are timeless. </p>
